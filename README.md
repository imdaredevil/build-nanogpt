# My own version of building GPT2 from scratch. 

In this repo, I am reproducing the changes in karpathy/build-nanogpt. 

We have the following objectives.

- learning to train a NN from a paper
- learning the nuances of pytorch/parallel programming/GPU
- trying out the things mentioned as future works in the video.
